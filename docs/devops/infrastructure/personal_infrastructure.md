# Personal Kubernetes Infrastructure

## Initial Setup

This are initial notes from Tim on setting up a personal docker, rancher desktop and rancher server testbed environment.

I started by setting up rancher desktop on my Fedora based linux laptop. I used the appimage (despite a concerning looking warning that firefox gives about the image when downloading it.)

Here is the [installation guide](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-via-appimage).

> **Note:** After upgrading to fedora 36 rancher desktop no longer started until I applied the following fix: [https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/2139#issuecomment-1114933138](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/2139#issuecomment-1114933138)

Once installed I performed the following commands to do a quick start setup of nginx running in the k8 cluster.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

> NAME                   STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

kubectl get pods

```bash

```

```bash

These steps are verbatim from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwE8IA3glE4).

From this initial run through we can assume these basic concepts:

![K8 Concepts](img/k8-concepts.png)

## Deploying Rancher on Rancher Desktop

I remember that Dominic explained about namespaces in his initial walk through so let me try to create a new  namespace.

```bash
kubectl create namespace tim
```

While trying to figure out how to list my namespaces, I found [this nice k8 cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/).

The above cheatsheet didnt actually contain the tip I needed but a bit of googling came up with this:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces --show-labels
```

> NAME              STATUS   AGE     LABELS
> default           Active   141m    kubernetes.io/metadata.name=default
> kube-system       Active   141m    kubernetes.io/metadata.name=kube-system
> kube-public       Active   141m    kubernetes.io/metadata.name=kube-public
> kube-node-lease   Active   141m    kubernetes.io/metadata.name=kube-node-lease
> tim               Active   3m34s   kubernetes.io/metadata.name=tim

You can see my tim namespace listed as the last entry there. So based on doing that, I think I can update my concept diagram to look like this:

![K8 Namespace](img/k8-concepts-namespace.png)

```bash
kubectl
```

> apiVersion: v1
> kind: Pod
> metadata:
> name: nginxpod
> namespace: tim
> labels:
> name: nginxpod
> spec:
> containers:
>
> - name: web
>     image: nginx

I saved the above as nginx.yml and was able to run it like this:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx.yml
```

Then I could check in the tim namespace to see if it was running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

> NAMESPACE     NAME                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
> kube-system   local-path-provisioner-84bb864455-dsv47   1/1     Running     0          150m

> kube-system   traefik-56c4b88c4b-mpwfm                  1/1     Running     0          150m
> kube-system   metrics-server-ff9dbcb6c-6gzt5            1/1     Running     0          150m
> default       nginx-6799fc88d8-7k4kd                    1/1     Running     0          69m
> tim           nginxpod                                  1/1     Running     0          14s

We can see my nginx pod in my namespace as the last entry.

## Installing Rancher on Rancher Desktop

I went [here](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/) for instructions.

```bash
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
kubectl create namespace cattle-system
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher   --namespace cattle-system   --set hostname=crest   --set replicas=1 --set ingress.tls.source=secret
```

A little note here: the above tutorial provides different pathways to get a certificate. I am using ingress.tls.source=secret because I am just running on my local sytstem. In production you probably want to use a different option. Also I reduced replicas to 1 since I only have 1 pod in my local test environment.

After running, I got a nice message saying rancher is setting itself up:

> NAME: rancher
> LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Apr 24 11:25:45 2022
> NAMESPACE: cattle-system
> STATUS: deployed
> REVISION: 1

>
> **NOTE:** Rancher may take several minutes to fully initialize. Please standby while Certificates are being issued, Containers are started and the Ingress rule comes up.
>

>
> To get just the bootstrap password on its own, run:
>
> kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{.data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode}}{{ "\n" }}'
>
>
> Happy Containering!
> ```

Let's use our experience from the simple nginx deployment to see what is running on the system now:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

> NAMESPACE                   NAME                                      READY   STATUS              RESTARTS      AGE

We can see various jobs are still spinning up in the cattle-system.

Next I went on a [little detour](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/create-a-self-signed-tls-certificate/) on creating a self signed certificate that I can install in my rancher instance.

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 \
-nodes -out tls.crt -keyout tls.key
```

> **Note:** I believe it is required to name the key tls.* so as to match the secret name.

Which outputs this:

> Generating a RSA private key
> writing new private key to 'tls.key'
> You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
> into your certificate request.
> What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
> There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
> For some fields there will be a default value,
> If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
> Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:pt
> State or Province Name (full name) []:
> Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:
> Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:
> Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
> Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:
> Email Address []:tim@kartoza.com
>  

Then we have two certs in our directory:
>
```bash
ls
```

> tls.crt  tls.key  nginx.yml

Then on [this rancher page](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/resources/tls-secrets/), I followed these notes to install my cert:

```bash
kubectl -n cattle-system create secret tls tls-rancher-ingress \
  --cert=tls.crt \
  --key=tls.key
secret/tls-rancher-ingress created
```

Ok then back to the [main thread](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/installation/install-rancher-on-k8s/#6-verify-that-the-rancher-server-is-successfully-deployed) of the rancher installation tutorial I continued:

```bash
kubectl -n cattle-system rollout status deploy/rancher
```

Which returns this:

> deployment "rancher" successfully rolled out

## Testing it out

The instructions say to open the host in your browser (in my case I used my local hostname of crest), but nothing opened.

I took a look in rancher desktop and played with the port forwarding. The default install looked like this:

![Default Ports](img/k8-rancher-desktop-ports-after-rancher-install.png)

So I went ahead and tried to forward that rancher port:

![Port Forward Option](img/k8-rancher-desktop-port-forward-after-rancher-install.png)

Then tried to open <https://localhost:37443/>

Which gave me an error:

![Certificate Error](img/k8-rancher-desktop-error-after-rancher-install.png
)

The thing seems to be that you need to rather forward this port:

![Port Forward Option](img/k8-rancher-desktop-ports-after-rancher-install-working.png)

Then I was able ot open the site (different port number now) an set up my credentials following the hints provided.

> **Note**: Since I am using a self signed cert I had to do the normal firefox security warning process to proceed to the site.

![Port Forward Option](img/k8-rancher-running.png)

I did however still have some errors now showing in rancher:

## Deploying a small application from a helm chart

I know helm charts are like the package managers of kubernetes, but I am not familiar with them, so I went to make a small test with the filebrowser.org (awesome app btw). I found these instructions and so ran and deployed it like this:

```bash
helm repo add utkuozdemir https://utkuozdemir.org/helm-charts
helm install my-release utkuozdemir/filebrowser
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods kubernetes.io/name=filebrowser,app.ease" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}
export CONTAINER_PORT=$(kubectl get pod E -o jsonpath="{.spec.containers0].ports[0]. 
echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use 
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:$CONTAINER_PORT
```

From this I learned a couple of things:

1. We can pull helm charts from the internet with a system of repos
2. We can use xpath style queries to parse out bits of info from kubectl
3. The last line gives some hints about how to foward traffic out of k8
